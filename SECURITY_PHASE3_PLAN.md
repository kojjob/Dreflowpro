# Security Phase 3 Implementation Plan

## Overview
Phase 3 focuses on advanced security features including enhanced authentication, session management, API security, and comprehensive security monitoring.

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 3 Security Objectives

### 1. Advanced Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA/2FA)
- [ ] Biometric authentication support
- [ ] OAuth2 scope management
- [ ] Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enhancements
- [ ] Permission-based authorization

### 2. Session Management & Security
- [ ] Session fingerprinting
- [ ] Concurrent session limits
- [ ] Session activity monitoring
- [ ] Secure session storage
- [ ] Session hijacking prevention

### 3. API Security Enhancements
- [ ] API key management system
- [ ] API versioning security
- [ ] Request signing (HMAC)
- [ ] API rate limiting per key
- [ ] Webhook security

### 4. Data Protection
- [ ] Field-level encryption
- [ ] Encryption at rest
- [ ] Data masking for PII
- [ ] Secure data deletion
- [ ] Backup encryption

### 5. Input Validation & Sanitization
- [ ] Comprehensive input validation
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] XSS protection enhancements
- [ ] File upload security
- [ ] Command injection prevention

### 6. Security Monitoring & Analytics
- [ ] Security dashboard
- [ ] Real-time threat detection
- [ ] Anomaly detection system
- [ ] Security metrics tracking
- [ ] Compliance reporting

### 7. Infrastructure Security
- [ ] Secrets management system
- [ ] Certificate management
- [ ] Container security
- [ ] Network segmentation
- [ ] Zero-trust architecture
