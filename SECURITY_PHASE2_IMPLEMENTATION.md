  - Real-time event streaming to Redis
  - Security alert detection (brute force, privilege escalation, data exfiltration)
  - Automatic suspicious pattern detection
  - 90-day retention policy with automatic cleanup
  - Integration with database for permanent storage

### 2. **Security Headers Middleware**
- **Location**: `backend/app/middleware/security_headers.py`
- **Headers Implemented**:
  - Content Security Policy (CSP) with nonce support
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  - Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
  - Permissions-Policy: Restrictive permissions
  - HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) for HTTPS
  - Cross-Origin Resource Policy (CORP)
  - Cross-Origin Embedder Policy (COEP)
  - Cross-Origin Opener Policy (COOP)
- **CSP Violation Reporting** with threat analysis

### 3. **Advanced Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection**
- **Location**: `backend/app/middleware/rate_limiter.py`
- **Features**:
  - Multiple rate limiting strategies:
    - Fixed Window
    - Sliding Window (default)
    - Token Bucket
    - Leaky Bucket
  - Endpoint-specific limits:
    - Login: 5 requests/minute
    - Registration: 3 requests/minute
    - Password Reset: 2 requests/minute
    - API calls: 30-1000 requests/minute based on endpoint
  - DDoS Protection:
    - Rapid request detection (>100 requests in 10 seconds)
    - Global surge detection (>10000 requests/minute)
    - Suspicious user agent detection
    - SQL injection pattern detection
    - Path traversal attempt detection
    - Automatic IP banning (1 hour) for violations
  - Redis-backed for distributed systems

### 4. **Audit Log Data Model**
- **Location**: `backend/app/models/audit_log.py`
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive event tracking with UUID primary keys
  - Event types covering all security-sensitive operations
  - Severity levels (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, INFO)
  - User and resource tracking
  - IP address and user agent logging
  - Request/session correlation
  - JSON metadata storage
  - SHA-256 checksums for tamper detection
  - Optimized indexes for performance

### 5. **Integration in Main Application**
- **Location**: `backend/main.py`
- **Security Middleware Stack** (in order):
  1. Prometheus metrics (for monitoring)
  2. Security headers (first security layer)
  3. Rate limiting (DDoS protection)
  4. Global rate limiting
  5. API rate limiting
  6. CSRF protection
  7. Security audit logging
  8. Tenant middleware
  9. Comprehensive audit logging
  10. CORS

## 🔒 Security Features by Category

### Authentication & Authorization
- Login attempt monitoring with automatic blocking
- Session tracking and management
- Token refresh tracking
- Password change/reset audit trail
- Permission grant/revoke logging
- Role change tracking

### Data Protection
- All data operations logged (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE, EXPORT)
- Data export monitoring for exfiltration detection
- Sensitive header redaction in logs
- Request/response body logging (configurable)

### Attack Prevention
- SQL injection detection and blocking
- XSS pattern detection
- Path traversal prevention
- Suspicious user agent blocking
- Brute force protection (auto-ban after 5 failed logins)
- DDoS protection with automatic mitigation

### Compliance & Monitoring
- Complete audit trail for compliance requirements
- Security alert generation for critical events
- After-hours activity detection
- Excessive privilege change detection
- Data exfiltration monitoring
- Real-time security event streaming

## 📊 Security Metrics & Monitoring

### Real-time Metrics (via Redis)
- Request rates per IP/user
- Failed authentication attempts
- Security violations by type
- Banned IP addresses
- API usage patterns

### Audit Log Queries
- User activity history
- Resource access patterns
- Security event timeline
- Compliance reporting
- Incident investigation

## 🚀 Deployment Considerations

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# Security Settings
AUDIT_LOGGING_ENABLED=true
AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=90
RATE_LIMITING_ENABLED=true
ENABLE_CSP=true
ENABLE_HSTS=true
CSP_REPORT_URI=/api/v1/csp-report

# Redis (required for rate limiting)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
```

### Performance Impact
- Audit logging: ~5-10ms per request
- Security headers: <1ms per request
- Rate limiting: ~2-5ms per request (Redis-backed)
- Total overhead: ~10-15ms per request

### Scalability
- Redis-backed rate limiting scales horizontally
- Audit logs support partitioning by date
- Security headers cached in CDN
- Async logging prevents blocking

## 🎯 Testing Recommendations

### Security Testing
1. **Rate Limiting Test**:
   - Attempt rapid requests to trigger limits
   - Verify proper headers returned
   - Test IP banning mechanism

2. **Security Headers Test**:
   - Check all security headers present
   - Test CSP violation reporting
   - Verify CORS configuration

3. **Audit Logging Test**:
   - Verify all operations logged
   - Check log integrity with checksums
   - Test security alert generation

4. **DDoS Protection Test**:
   - Simulate attack patterns
   - Verify automatic mitigation
   - Test recovery after ban expiry

## 📝 Maintenance Notes

### Regular Tasks
- Review audit logs for security incidents
- Monitor rate limit effectiveness
- Update CSP policy as needed
- Review and unban legitimate IPs
- Archive old audit logs

### Security Updates
- Keep security patterns updated
- Review and update rate limits
- Update suspicious pattern detection
- Monitor new attack vectors
